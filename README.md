Editable-Printable Purchase Order Template

Modify the print.css if you need to change the features of the print version
Modify the example.js if you need to add/modify the columns of the order/invoice or to add some better logic

You can change most of the textareas I used to div's with ""contenteditable" set to true. Textareas worked for me.

To get the print version (pdf/xps)-
1. Open the purchase order in your browser (preferable chrome)
2. Edit the particulars to suit your needs
3. Print (keyboard shortcut- Ctrl-P usually for windows)
4. Change the default to printer to "Save As PDF" which is available in most browsers. If not, enable it in your browsers settings, here's how-

5. Change the file name to whatever suits you. (if you have a solution that generates an automatic PO Number and makes that the filename, please suggest one) And you're good to go.
